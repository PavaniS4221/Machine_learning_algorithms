## 📌 Math Behind One-Hot Encoding

One-Hot Encoding is a technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical form so that machine learning models can process them without introducing false relationships between categories.

Let a categorical variable **X** have **k distinct categories**:

[
X \in {c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k}
]

One-Hot Encoding defines a mapping:

[
f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k
]

Each category (c_i) is mapped to a **k-dimensional binary vector** called a **standard basis vector**:

[
f(c_i) = \mathbf{e}_i = (0, 0, \dots, 1, \dots, 0)
]

where only the (i^{th}) position is 1 and all others are 0.

### 🔹 Example

If:

[
Color \in {Red, Green, Blue}
]

Then the one-hot encodings are:

* Red → (1, 0, 0)
* Green → (0, 1, 0)
* Blue → (0, 0, 1)

---

### 🔹 Geometric Interpretation

Each one-hot vector lies along a unique axis in a k-dimensional space.

For any two different categories (i \neq j):

[
\mathbf{e}_i \cdot \mathbf{e}_j = 0
]

This means the vectors are **orthogonal**, ensuring:

* No ordering between categories
* Equal distance between all categories

The Euclidean distance between any two categories is:

[
|\mathbf{e}_i - \mathbf{e}_j| = \sqrt{2}
]

---

### 🔹 Why One-Hot Encoding is Needed

Label encoding assigns arbitrary numerical order (e.g., Red = 0, Green = 1, Blue = 2), which introduces a **false ordinal relationship**.
One-Hot Encoding avoids this by representing each category independently.

### 🔹 Effect on Linear Models

In linear and logistic regression models:

[
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \dots + \beta_kx_k
]

Each one-hot feature has its own coefficient, allowing the model to learn the **independent contribution** of each category.

---

### 🔹 Dummy Variable Trap

If all k one-hot columns are used:

[
x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = 1
]

This causes **perfect multicollinearity**.
To avoid this, one column is dropped, leaving **k−1 features**, and the dropped category becomes the **baseline**.

---

### 🔹 Key Advantages

* Prevents false ordering of categories
* Treats all categories equally
* Works well with linear and distance-based models

### 🔹 Limitation

* Increases dimensionality when categories are many
